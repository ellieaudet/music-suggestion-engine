# music-suggestion-engine
Uses the compilations two artists have appeared on to yield a suggestion for similar artists. First we use the Discogs API to get the artist codes, then we use the artist codes to scrape the discogs website for all the compilations they appear under. Finally we compare the two lists of all artists from all compilations.

## Example:
